## 🎨 Design Trends Applied (2025/2026)

Based on frontend-design and web-design-guidelines skills:

1. **Bold Typography**
   - Ditched generic fonts (Inter, Roboto)
   - Used distinctive pairings (Fraunces + JetBrains Mono for A)

2. **Intentional Color**
   - Avoided purple gradients on white
   - Chose cohesive palettes with strong accents
   - Used CSS variables for consistency

3. **Motion & Delight**
   - CSS-only animations
   - Staggered reveals on scroll
   - Terminal typing effects
   - Hover states that surprise

4. **Spatial Composition**
   - Asymmetric layouts
   - Generous negative space
   - Grid-breaking elements
   - Alternating light/dark sections

5. **Context-Specific Design**
   - Terminal visualization for tech credibility
   - Editorial layout for readability
   - Code-inspired elements match product (AI/ML)

## 📝 Copywriting Strategy

Applied principles from copywriting skill:

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- "Never watch a course just to forget it" (clear pain point)
- Not: "Revolutionize your learning experience" (vague)

### Benefits Over Features
- "Turn 4-hour courses into 8-minute action plans"
- Not: "Advanced AI transcription and summarization"

### Specificity Over Vagueness
- "Chat with AI trained on 1,000+ courses"
- "Runs 100% locally on your machine"
- "Extract frameworks, not just highlights"

### Customer Language
- "Never watch a course just to forget it"
- "Information overload"
- "No bridge to action"

### Page Structure
1. Hero: Pain point + solution
2. Problem: Show understanding
3. Solution: Connect to outcomes
4. How It Works: Reduce complexity
5. Use Cases: Prove application
6. Differentiation: Clear comparison
7. Final CTA: Recap + action
