# Variant A: Editorial Tech

**Aesthetic:** Clean, magazine-style layout with bold typography and tech-inspired elements.

## Design Choices

### Typography
- **Display:** Fraunces (distinctive serif with personality)
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (for code/terminal elements)
- **Body:** System fonts (fast loading, clean)

**Why:** Fraunces brings editorial elegance while JetBrains Mono adds technical credibility. This pairing says "smart but accessible."

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Cyan/Teal (#00D9FF) - fresh, modern, tech-forward
- **Dark:** Deep navy (#0A0E27) - sophisticated, not harsh
- **Accent:** Yellow (#FFD60A) - for highlights and energy

**Why:** Cyan feels innovative without being cold. Avoids overused purple gradients and generic blues.

### Layout
- **Asymmetric hero** - 1.2fr / 1fr split creates visual interest
- **Terminal window** - Establishes technical credibility immediately
- **Alternating sections** - Light/dark backgrounds create rhythm

### Key Features
1. **Terminal visualization** - Shows product in action, not just describes it
2. **Animated elements** - Blinking cursor, typing effect, scroll reveals
3. **Comparison table** - Clearly differentiates from competitors
4. **Real use cases** - Specific examples, not vague claims

## Copywriting Strategy

### Headlines
- **"Never watch a course just to forget it"** - Addresses core pain point directly
- Not generic ("Transform your learning") or too clever
- Specific and relatable

### Structure
1. **Problem → Solution → Differentiation**
2. Each section advances one argument
3. Social proof throughout (1,000+ courses, open source)

### Voice
- Confident but not salesy
- Technical but not jargony
- "You" language throughout (reader-focused)

### CTAs
- **"Join the Alpha"** (not "Sign Up" - implies exclusivity)
- **"Get Early Access"** (benefit-focused)
- Repeated but natural (hero + final section)

## Technical Implementation
- **Zero dependencies** - Pure HTML/CSS/vanilla JS
- **Smooth animations** - CSS-based, performant
- **Responsive** - Mobile-first approach
- **Accessible** - Semantic HTML, proper contrast

## Target Audience
- Designers and creative professionals
- People who value aesthetics + function
- Those overwhelmed by course libraries

## What Makes It Work
1. **Visual proof** - Terminal shows actual interaction
2. **Specificity** - "4 hours → 8 minutes", not "save time"
3. **Clear differentiation** - Table shows exactly how it's different
4. **Real examples** - Marketing, design, business use cases
