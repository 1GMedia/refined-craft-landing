# RefinedCraft - Project Context

## Core Concept

**Problem:**
Course creators sell courses with hours of video content. Business owners don't have time to sit through it all. Courses accumulate, become outdated, but contain valuable principles.

**Solution:**
RefinedCraft - AI trained on online courses. You feed your course library, it outputs first principles and cites sources so you can APPLY immediately.

## Visual Inspiration

**Matrix Knowledge Upload Scene:**

Neo uploads knowledge directly to his brain. This is the abstract visual concept we want to capture - the idea that you can upload knowledge to your head instantly.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Just in Time Learning"**
- Not "watch 10 hours of video"
- But "get the exact principle you need, right now, with citations"

## How It Works

1. **Transcription** - Convert video courses to searchable text
2. **Indexing** - Organize and structure the knowledge
3. **AI Agents** - Extract first principles and provide citations

## Project Status

- **Open source** - Passionate about solving this problem
- **User's course library** - Bought many courses over the years, too much content to ever review
- **Real need** - Principles are good, but mixed with outdated content

## Website Design Goal

Visualize the abstract concept of knowledge uploading - Matrix-style brain upload meets modern course learning.
